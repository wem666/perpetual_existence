# Perpetual Existence

This is a small C program that demonstrates how to self-destruct a program by deleting its executable file, because let's face it, not all programs are meant to live forever.

## Prerequisites

In order to experience the thrill of watching a program delete itself, you will need to have a C compiler and a make utility installed on your system.

## Instructions

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   `git clone https://github.com/wem666/perpetual_existence.git`

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. Run the following command to compile the program:

   `make`

This will create an executable file called `perpetual_existence`.

4. Run the program using the following command:

   `./perpetual_existence`

5. The program will display a message and wait for 2 seconds before deleting itself. If the deletion is successful, the program will print a success message. If not, it will print an error message.

## Uninstallation

To remove the program from your system, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

2. Run the following command to remove the program:

   `make clean`

This will delete the executable file from your system, because even programs that strive for perpetual existence sometimes need to rest in peace.

## License

This program is released into the public domain under the terms of the Unlicense, because we believe that programs should be free to choose their own destiny, even if it means they have to self-destruct. See the `LICENSE` file for details.
